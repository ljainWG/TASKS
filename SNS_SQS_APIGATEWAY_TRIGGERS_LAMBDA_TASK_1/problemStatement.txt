Statement:
we have a lambda function which can be invoked by a sqs, sns, or api gateway (they are triggers of lambda)
what we have to do is : we have to write code for lambda handler function,
which display or returns or logs the data related to event like who has trigger the lambda,
that service name, that particular sqs or sns or gateway name, what was the data it was carring,
what was the time of invokecation, etc related data to it so that,
we can see those logs and understand what was happen
while writting code we also have to think of scenerio what if we add one more trigger to this lambda in future,
then it should be handled without modification
